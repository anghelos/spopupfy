# Spopupfy

> A simple Firefox addon that pops up a mini player on [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com/).

## Usage
When navigating to [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com/), a small icon will appear on the lower-right corner of the window. Clicking it will move the window to the top-left corner of the screen, and re-style it into a mini player. Click the icon again to restore the original window.

## Screenshots

## Limitations

I have unfortunately not been able to find a way to remove the window decorations on Firefox. I will probably update this to Manifest V3 when Firefox adopts it, and see if a solution exists there.
